## Background

In a world where corporations can scan the human mind and interface it directly with electronic data, more data moves every second than was ever processed in the first five-thousand years of written language. The network is omnipresent, the crux of modern human civilization, and while visionary corporations seek to secure their most valuable data on the network, the elite hackers known as netrunners seek to steal it.

## Description

Netrunners is a social deduction game, much like The Resistance, a game with secret identities.
Players are either Netrunners attempting to compromise corrupt corporations, or corpo spies trying to thwart the Netrunners.

## Game Summary

**<li>Assign Non-participant host</li>**
**<li>Assign Roles</li>**
**<li>Assign Leader</li>**
**<li>Build Mission Team</li>**
**<li>Conduct Mission</li>**
**<li>Secret Mission if applicable</li>**

## Object of the Game

The Netrunners win the game if three Missions are completed successfully.
The Spies win if three Missions fail.
The Spies can also win if the Netrunners are unable to organize the Mission Team at any point in the game (5 failed votes on a single mission).

## Spy

A fundamental rule of the game is that players may say anything that they want, at anytime during the game. You are allowed to say anything, to any one, at any time as long as it is said publicly. 
Discussion, deception, intuition, social interaction and logical deductions are all equally important to winning.

## Setup

1) Select a non-participant Host, this person will facilitate exchange of hidden information(Spy status, Mission Votes, etc), and is not allowed to participate in Team Assignment related discussions

2) Randomly select a Leader;

Use the chart below to determine the number of Netrunners and Spies that will be in the game.

<pre>
Players        5 6 7 8 9 10
Netrunners     3 4 4 5 6 6 
Spies          2 2 3 3 3 4 
</pre>

3) Randomly assign player roles, spies will be made aware of each others presence 
   (by way of a non participant-host)

## Gameplay

The game consists of several Rounds; each Round comprised of a:

a) Team-Building Phase
b) Mission Phase

### Build the Team

The team building phase consists of the Leader picking the players that he would like on the Mission Team followed by all the players voting to approve/reject the Mission Team.

Mission Team Assignment: 
After appropriate discussion, the Leader selects the Mission Team (using the chart below) Note a player may only be assigned to one Mission Team at a time.

<pre>
Players            5 6 7 8 9 10
1st Mission Team   2 2 2 3 3 3
2nd Mission Team   3 3 3 4 4 4
3rd Mission Team   2 4 3 4 4 4
4th Mission Team   3 3 4 5 5 5
5th Mission Team   3 4 4 5 5 5
</pre>

Mission Team Vote:
After appropriate discussion, the Leader calls for a vote on the team assignments. Each player, including the leader, secretly votes, sending these votes to the non-participant host.

If the mission team is approved, play continues in the mission phase. If the mission team is rejected, the leader role passes in a clockwise manner and the team building phase is repeated.
The spies win the game if five mission teams are rejected in a single round (5 failed votes).

### Conducting the Mission

Mission Success:
Each player sends votes to the non-participant host on whether the mission fails or succeeds. 
The mission is successful only if all votes are for a successful mission. The mission fails if one (or more) fails have been voted.

Note: The runners must select success; spies may select either the success or fail.

The 4th mission in games of 7 or more players requires at least two fails for it to be a failed mission.

After the mission has been completed, mark the mission success or mission fail for later. The leader passes in a clockwise manner and the team building phase of the next round begins.

### Secret Missions

On the 2nd, 4th, and 5th missions opportunities for secret missions are taken. When taken, the players assembled for the previous mission team make an attempt at solving a randomly selected problem (2nd and 4th missions being easy problems, 5th being a hard problem)
The runners are given a max of 5 minutes to complete the easy problems, and 15 for hard problems. 

Upon completion a temporary leader is randomly chosen from the Mission Team, and that leader selects a new team, with, or without discussion from the rest of the team, to then send on a secret mission.
If any member on the secret mission is a spy, the mission automatically fails, but does not count against the runners.

If the problem is failed and the time expired, nothing happens and continue to the next Round.

### End of the game

The game ends immediately after either three successful or three failed missions. The Runners wins if three missions are successful. The spies win if three missions fail.

Notes: information in Netrunners comes at multiple levels.<br>
First are players' voting patterns, second are Mission results, third Secret Mission results, and fourth are cues that you can discern from player interactions. Netrunners must use all the information at hand to root out the Corpo Spy infestation.
